Protein Name : Gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase 
Protein ID : PROA_LEGPH
EC Number : 1.2.1.41
Protein Length : 417
Cellular Locale : cytoplasm
Status : Reviewed
Biological Process : ['L-proline biosynthetic process']
Molecular Function : ['glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase activity', 'NADP binding']
Function :  Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of L-glutamate 5-phosphate into L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde and phosphate. The product spontaneously undergoes cyclization to form 1-pyrroline-5- carboxylate.
